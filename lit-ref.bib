  abstract =     {This paper extends the study of the continuous Berth Allocation Problem to the case of multiple quays,
                  which is found in many container terminals around the world. Considering multiple quays adds a problem
                  of assigning vessels to quays to the problem of determining berthing times and positions for each
                  incoming vessel. This problem has not been considered in the literature at the operational level
                  addressed in this study. In order to solve it, we have developed first an integer linear model and
                  then a genetic algorithm which works on sequences of vessels that are decoded by a constructive
                  algorithm. A local search procedure helps to improve further the solutions produced by the genetic
                  algorithm. We have conducted an extensive computational experiment, adapting existing instances to the
                  case of multiple quays. We have also adapted our genetic algorithm to the case of a single quay and
                  tested it on previously reported instances, showing its superior performance compared with existing
                  approaches. Finally, we have developed a random instance generator for the problem with multiple
                  quays, enabling us to conduct a systematic study of the factors affecting the complexity of the
                  problem.},

  abstract =     {Because of zero emissions and other social and economic benefits, electric vehicles (EVs) are
                  currently being introduced in more and more transit agencies around the world. One of the most
                  challenging tasks involves efficiently scheduling a set of EVs considering the limited driving range
                  and charging requirement constraints. This study examines the battery-electric transit vehicle
                  scheduling problem (BET-VSP) with stationary battery chargers installed at transit terminal stations.
                  Two equivalent versions of mathematical formulations of the problem are provided. The first
                  formulation is based on the deficit function theory, and the second formulation is an equivalent
                  bi-objective integer programming model. The first objective of the math-programming optimization is to
                  minimize the total number of EVs required, while the second objective is to minimize the total number
                  of battery chargers required. To solve this bi-objective BET-VSP, two solution methods are developed.
                  First, a lexicographic method-based two-stage construction-and-optimization solution procedure is
                  proposed. Second, an adjusted max-flow solution method is developed. Three numerical examples are used
                  as an expository device to illustrate the solution methods, together with a real-life case study in
                  Singapore. The results demonstrate that the proposed math-programming models and solution methods are
                  effective and have the potential to be applied in solving large-scale real-world BET-VSPs.},

  abstract =     {Electric transit buses have been recognized as an important alternative to diesel buses with many
                  environmental benefits. Electric buses employing lithium titanate batteries can provide uninterrupted
                  transit service thanks to their ability of fast charging. However, fast charging may result in high
                  demand charges which will increase the fuel costs thereby limiting the electric bus market
                  penetration. In this paper, we simulated daily charging patterns and demand charges of a fleet of
                  electric buses in Tallahassee, Florida and identified an optimal charging strategy to minimize demand
                  charges. It was found that by using a charging threshold of 60-64\%, a \$160,848 total saving in
                  electricity cost can be achieved for a five electric bus fleet, comparing to a charging threshold of
                  0-28\%. In addition, the impact of fleet sizes on the fuel cost was investigated. Fleets of 4 and 12
                  buses will achieve the lowest cost per mile driven when one fast charger is installed.},

  abstract =     {In this article, optimization problems with bilinear constraints involving one discrete variable are
                  studied. Several industrial problems present bilinear non-convex constraints which are difficult to
                  solve to global optimality. For this purpose models must be reformulated what in general terms
                  increases the problem size. This article proposes two disjunctive transformation techniques which are
                  compared to other approaches presented in the literature. An analysis is made comparing qualitative
                  and quantitative characteristics of the methods employed. In order to implement proposed
                  transformations, three industrial cases are studied: trim-loss in a paper mill, cutting stock in the
                  production of carton board boxes and the purchase, inventory and delivery optimization problem. All of
                  them are reformulated and solved using the strategies included in the paper. Several instances of each
                  problem are evaluated and their results are analyzed comparing performance of the different methods.},
